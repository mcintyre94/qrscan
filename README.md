# SimpleScan

SimpleScan is a simple QR code scanner

Every QR code scanning app is full of ads, so put this on your home screen instead

The app is entirely static, never stores your data or sends it anywhere and can be self-hosted anywhere.

## Credit

The QR scanning library used is the excellent https://github.com/nimiq/qr-scanner
